# TextBasedGame
The first project I made. It's a text game made in Python

Used in this project:
<ul>
  Python
  Basic programming principles
</ul>

The idea is to navigate your way around the environment, find your pieces of equipment, and then enter the final room. When you enter a room, the terminal gives the user a description of the room - where doors are, any suspicious items in the room - and asks the user for input. The user's input determines whether the character moves to a new room or investigates a suspicious item. The user must find all the equipment before navigating to the final room or they will lose the game. If they find all the equipment and then go to the final room, they win the game.

I made this project in September of last year (2022) and it was my first real jump into using any programming language. I was really happy with how it turned out at the time.

Looking back, I think it would be fun to add some graphical elements with the PyGame library and tighten up some of the workings of it. So at some point in the future, I may come back to this to add some more bits to the program.
